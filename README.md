## Machine Learning Scripts
This repo exists to store interesting projects that can be run in jupyter notebook or spyder relating to machine learning that I have been working on over the years. 

## Deep Neural Network for Binary Classification
This script is a jupyter notebook that implements a deep neural network using numpy, feel free to use the functions to train with your own data.
